  <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
  <h2>Who I am, what I bring into this Journey?</h2>
  <br>
  <div class="values"><h2>How culture influnences my values and identity</h2>
    <p>Culture has played a big part in my life. It has shaped my values and identity to this day.
      Being a middle eastern and trying to adopt a western life at a young age has had its unique challeneges and opportunities.
      My middle eastern roots, culture and traditions have sometimes clashed with living in a modern western society. My biggest takeaway has to be the way we socialise, 
      socialising is very different, how we interact with people and carry out customs truly did allow me to have a unique perspective in day to day interactions with people and having a unique appreciation of the variation of cultural norms.
      As I grew into adulthood, I truly have a better appreciation for having a unique culture as it allowed me to understand people and why they do what they do.
    </p>
    <div class="values"><h2>My strengths and limitations</h2>
    <p>I think very logically and systematically. I like to reduce problems to their atomic level before solving them and making sense of the overall picture.</p>
    <p>I have a desire to learn something to its entirety and completely understand the topic in its depth. 
      I like to build my foundations from the ground up. From my past experiences, taking shortcuts in your learning will catch you out at some stage in your profession.
      The one thing that will help me stay focused and excited is managing my time well and removing as much distraction from my computer desk as I do sometimes tend to wander off. I like to focus on one thing at a time to create more clarity of the objectives and tasks.

    <h2>Which Strengths will help me in my learning journey</h2>
    <p>Thinking logically and breaking problems down until they are solvable and knowing how and when to break problems well translates well to my learning journey. Coding is all about breaking problems down into smaller bits and then solving them one by one.
      Being able to understand people and socialise with them appropriately will help keep the doors of collaboration open and warm. Half the challenge is the human side and being able to work with people from all walks of life.

    <h2>Examples of when there was resistance/ tension in a work setting</h2>
    <p> One professional experience of this that I have encountered during a work setting was in the NZ Army when my group consisting of 8 soldiers were tasked with establishing radio communication with HQ meanwhile managing our enviroment and establishing our sleeping posts.
      It was a particularly cold night, everyone was very tired from a full week of military exercises however on this occasion we were tasked with setting up communciation when we all were tired, hungry and wet.
      Tension was rising between the team as we were trying to manage responsibilities, on this occasion, our team morale was a little lower than usual due to weather and fatigue. I realised on this occasion that all team members needed to eat and have some hot brew before beginning the nightly activities. 
      Once we were fed, rested and had some down time to chat with one another share a few laughs, our spirits were high enough to complete a full radio test and establish communication whilst carrying out our routine evening duties.
