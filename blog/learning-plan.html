  <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
  <div class="learning">
    <h2>What is your career goal?</h2>
    <p>I want to become a software developer. My interest is in Full stack development. I see myself starting as a front end developer, and progressing to Fullstack over time.
      I want to be fully immersed in building applications in there entirety. I also have some personal projects I have always wanted to build but never had the time or opportunity to do so.
      I can see myself as a dedicated developer, building projects in a team envirement, constantly being curious, leanring from my peers and adding value to the project every single day.
    </p>

    <div class="learning"> 
      <h2>My strengths and weaknesses</h2>
      <p>I am a critical thinker and love to solve problems in a detailed and organised manner. This allows me to fully grasp concepts and completing my tasks thorougly,
        However at times I can over think and confuse my self and lose confidence in my ability. The way I can oversome this, is by asking for help and communicating with peers to get me back on track quickly (if googling does not work for).
      </p>
  </div>  
  <div class="values">
    <h2>What non-technical skills do I want to develop</h2>
    <p>I would truly like to work on having deeper connections with people, and having the ability to be empathetic and non judgemental. I truly want to develop authentic connection with my future work family and treat them with the utmost respect and regard them highly and always be encouraging, optimistic and positive toward them regardless of the condition, I feel like we can always be the better person for ourselves and for our peers. In a nutshell, I want to have more optimism and even more positivity to fuel my optmism, and I truly believe it all depends on the enviroment I build for myself</p>
  </div>
  <div class="values">
    <h2>How will I manage my work load</h2>
    <p>Better time management, more self discipline and having a strategy to overcome bad habits and create good ones. Good habits are a result of tiny wins that is just a little difficult to do but not a huge and uncomfortable step in the right direction. It's all about winning the little challenges, and building the condifence and trust to believe in yourself to continue seeking more challenges.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="values">
    <h2>When I need help</h2>
    <p>When I run into issues, the first action I take is to google the issue or problem I am trying to solve.
      If this does not work, I will look at the discord channel, youtube, online tutorials and sites such as stack overflow.
      If the issue is still unresolved after 25 minutes, I will look to ask a colleague, a peer and then my lecturer or manager for assistance.
      As a developer, it is important to set timelimits to trying to solve an issue, because the solution to the problem might be an easy fix and even if it is a difficult one, I will ask my lecturer and facilitators to challenge me and try to help me solve the problem myself with just enough push in the right direction.
      I believe 25 minutes if just the right amount of time to try and solve an issue and after this point, you need to seek help outside of your own bubble so that you can solve the issue and get to the next challenge.
      The more problems solved in a day, the more you learn and the more experience you have. So prioritising problem solving time is crucial to your success as a problem solver and a progressive developer.
